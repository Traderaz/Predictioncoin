## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ Read this document (you're doing it!)
2. ⏭️ Follow **[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)**
3. 🔥 Set up Firebase
4. 🧪 Test locally
5. 🚢 Deploy to Vercel

### Short Term (This Week)

- [ ] Customize colors/branding
- [ ] Create your first meme polls
- [ ] Share on Twitter
- [ ] Get feedback from users
- [ ] Add custom domain

### Long Term (This Month)

- [ ] Connect real Polymarket API
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement leaderboards
- [ ] Add analytics
- [ ] Grow your community

## 🔥 Firebase Requirements

You **MUST** set up Firebase for full functionality:

1. **Firestore Database** - Stores polls and votes
2. **Firebase Storage** - Stores uploaded images
3. **Security Rules** - Controls access (templates provided)

Without Firebase, the site will:
- ✅ Show the homepage with mock predictions
- ✅ Display the UI perfectly
- ❌ Not save votes
- ❌ Not upload images
- ❌ Not persist data

**Solution:** Follow [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) Step 2

## 💾 Environment Variables

You need these in `.env.local`:

\`\`\`env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
\`\`\`

Get them from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Polymarket Integration
Currently uses **mock data** that looks exactly like Polymarket. Ready to connect to real Polymarket API when you're ready.

**File:** `lib/polymarket.ts`

### Voting System
Uses Firebase Firestore with **optimistic updates** for instant feedback. Prevents duplicate votes per session.

**Files:** `app/meme-votes/page.tsx`, `components/MemePoll.tsx`

### Meme Generator
Uses **html2canvas** to convert your meme template to a downloadable PNG. Uploads images to Firebase Storage.

**Files:** `app/meme-generator/page.tsx`, `components/MemeTemplate.tsx`

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Can't find module" errors
→ Run `npm install`

### Firebase errors
→ Check `.env.local` exists with correct values
→ Restart dev server

### Vercel build fails
→ Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
→ Check build logs

### Images not uploading
→ Check Firebase Storage rules are published

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js`:
\`\`\`javascript
colors: {
  'prediction-blue': '#YOUR_COLOR',
}
\`\`\`

### Update Logo

Replace in `components/Header.tsx`:
\`\`\`tsx
<img src="/your-logo.png" alt="Logo" />
\`\`\`

### Add More Predictions

Edit `lib/polymarket.ts` → `mockPredictions` array
